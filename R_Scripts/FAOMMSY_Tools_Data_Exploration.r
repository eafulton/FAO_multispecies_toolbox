## Exploring data

# We are assuming that anyone reading this section is relatively new to R and so we 
# are providing simple scripts to show the steps needed to plot and work with data. 
# There are however very many professional packages and sophisticated data handling 
# approaches so we encourage the interested reader to look into what are the latest 
# tools available. As you become more familiar with R you will likely consider these 
# scripts simplistic, but they have the benefit of being relatively easy to follow, 
# please feel free to tailor your own scripts to whatever you feel is the best approach. 

# This script is to plot a stacked bar plot (essentially creating an area plot) 

# Clean up the R space - this is to make sure that there is no memory hold over from past analyses
rm(list=ls())			

# Load Libraries - relevant libraries needed in processing the data
library(tidyverse)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColourBrewer)

# This code assumes the data is formatted as a csv with a filename RawCatchData.csv
# Assumed column structure is
# Year	Gear	Area	Species	Group	Yield
#
#
# and for effort it assumes a csv with a filename RawEffortData.csv
# And assumed column structure
# Year	Gear	Area	Effort

# Load the data. We have chosen to use read.table so that you can specify 
# yourself whether you are using a true csv file with commas between the 
# values in a row (comma delimited) or whether you are using a tab delimited. 
# If you are sure you are using a true csv that is comma delimited then read.csv 
# or read_csv is also a good choice.

GoTCatchData <-read.table("RawCatchData.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
GoTEffortData <-read.table("RawEffortData.csv ", header=TRUE, sep = ",")

# These loaded datasets are known as dataframes

# Summarise the data. 
# To summarise the data pipe (%>%) the original data through a group_by(), 
# which lists which variables (columns) to use when grouping the data, 
# and then through summarise() which shows what actions to take. 
# summarise() has a lot of useful functions (options) to choose from such 
# as sum(), mean(), median(), min(), max(), quantile(), sd() which is the 
# standard deviation and n() which is count. The format of the summarise() call is 
# summarise( NewVariableName = function(DataColumnName))

# You can do more than one thing at a time. For example
# summarise( NewSum = sum(ColName), NewMean = mean(ColName))
# As multiple R libraries have a summarise() function included, to avoid 
# confusion some people like to make the call to the tidyverse (a useful R 
# package for handling data) version by writing dplyr::summarise. So to 
# summarise the catch and effort loaded in above we would use:
  
# Total catch per species per gear per year (i.e. sum over areas) 
SumCatchSp <- RawCatchData %>%
  group_by(Year, Gear, Species) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(TotalYieldSp = sum(Yield))

# Total catch per gear per year (i.e. sum over areas and species)
SumCatchGear <- RawCatchData %>%
  group_by(Year, Gear) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(TotalYieldGear = sum(Yield), MeanYieldGear = mean(Yield), StdDevYieldGear = sd(Yield))

# Total catch per year (i.e. sum over areas, gears and species)
SumTotalCatch <- RawCatchData %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(TotalYield = sum(Yield))

# Total effort per gear per year (i.e. sum over areas)
SumEffortGear <- RawCatchData %>%
  group_by(Year, Gear) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(TotalEffortGear = sum(Effort))

# For large datasets with many species you may want to group the species based
# on the kinds of functional groups listed earlier (e.g. Demersal fish, 
# Pelagic fish, Cephalopods etc). To do this you would summarise the data 
# per Group instead of Species: 
  
SumCatchGroup <- RawCatchData %>%
  group_by(Year, Gear, Group) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(TotalYieldGroup = sum(Yield))

# Do any simple data transformations that are necessary. For example to create 
# a raw CPUE (literally catch divided by effort with no further standardisation)

SumCPUE <- merge(SumCatchGear, SumEffort, by=c("Year","Gear "))
SumCPUE$CPUE <- (SumCPUE$TotalYieldGear / SumCPUE$TotalEffortGear)

# The first line merges the two data frames together into one – joining them 
# based on Year (y) and Gear (g). The second line then calculates CPUE as 
#〖CPUE〗_(y,g) =〖Catch〗_(y,g)/〖Effort〗_(y,g) 

# Also calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for catch. 
# Effort could be done in the same way
SumCatchGear$CV <- (SumCatchGear$StdDevYieldGear / SumCatchGear$MeanYieldGear) * 100.0

# Plot the results. A number of powerful plotting options exist in R. 
# For demonstration purposes we have chosen to use ggplot2 but if you are 
# more familiar with another approach please use that. In the examples below we 
# have put in bold the things that differ between the different scripts

# First create a mapping of the gear names to use in the plots
# GearLabel <- c("Name1", " Name2", " Name3", …. , " NameY")
# gear_names <- as_labeller(c(`GearCode1` = "Name1", ` GearCode2` = "Name3", …. , `GearCodeY` = "NameY"))

# Plot total catch per species per year – one stacked on top of the other – Using the BrownGreen colour palette
